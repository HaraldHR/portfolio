        <p>
          This was my first object-oriented programming project. It is a
          turn-based, terminal-based snake game for either two players or one
          player versus the computer.
          <br /><br />
          Each player controls a snake on a customizable grid. The goal is to
          grow longer than your opponent while avoiding death by
          collisionâ€”either with the walls, yourself, or the opponent. You can
          also attempt to eliminate your opponent by strategic movement.
          <br /><br />
          The game board dimensions (width and height) can be set before the
          game starts. Each match result is stored in a CSV file to maintain a
          highscore list across sessions.
