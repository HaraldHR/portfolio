        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This group project combines Arduino microcontrollers and a game
          developed in Processing to create a two-player local multiplayer
          experience. Each player uses a custom-built Arduino game controller
          made from physical sensors and actuators.
          <br /><br />
          The game, inspired by agar.io, was implemented in Processing and
          includes a basic client-server architecture. One computer runs the
          server and a player client, while another computer runs only a player
          client. The server manages game state and synchronizes gameplay over
          serial and network communication.
          <br /><br />
          Each Arduino communicates with its respective client using serial USB,
          translating hardware inputs (like button presses and joystick
          movement) into game commands (movement).
          <br /><br />
          The game also includes a feature where, by picking up a power-up, you
          may change what sensor your opponent has to use to play the game.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed and built one of the custom Arduino controllers using
            potentiometers and a accelerometer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrote an Arduino program to read input and communicate via serial.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated serial communication into the Processing game and mapped
            the input values to movement.
          </li>
          <li>Helped set up the client-server communication.</li>
